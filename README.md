# Workspace for LaTeX

I use [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for creating [the thesis](https://github.com/whynotkimhari/tdk-thesis/blob/master/elteiktdk_en.pdf) and [the presentation](https://github.com/whynotkimhari/tdk-thesis/blob/master/presentation.pdf).
